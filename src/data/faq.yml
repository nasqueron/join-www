    - question: How should I format my commit messages?
      slug: write-commit
      answer: |
        Commit messages should have a short, descriptive title followed by
        explanatory paragraphs. Those paragraphs should give context,
        explain the what and the why vs. how. Think yourself in 6 months
        of time asking "why I committed that?", that's the question you
        need to answer in the commit.
