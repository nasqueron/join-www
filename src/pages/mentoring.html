            <h2>Tracks :: What would be the best mentoring fit?</h2>
            <p>Currently, we can provide meaningful mentoring in operations (think DevOps/SRE or systems engineer),
               and in software development. There is a strong focus on infrastructure, automation and security.</p>
            <p>Nasqueron uses an heterogeneous environment with FreeBSD and Linux systems, so we're pretty UNIX-agnostic,
                and can help you to avoid to be Linux-centric.</p>
            <p>We code in Rust, and we also code in PHP, like modern PHP with static analysis and types. We know C too.
            Our operations infrastructure uses a lot of Python, a little dash of Go, some older TCL scripts.
                There are also a few projects in Node.JS.</p>
            <p>So what that says about us? That's mean we're pretty open in the field of languages and choose them by strength and
                use cases, instead of dogmatic choices. That means we touch a complex technical stack and can help in
                various aspects of an infrastructure.</p>
