            <p>This site content is a language model exercise: this site is born
                when ChatGPT answered to a prompt asking for a “brief“ section
                "About Nasqueron" to offer internship. The “brief“ answers was
                9 paragraphs, 22 sentences and 2 567 characters.</p>
            <p>Small images have been generated by Stable Diffusion,
                with prompts suggested by ChatGPT.</p>
            <p>The CSS uses Foundation framework. This is a static site built with
                a Gulp / SASS / <a href="https://get.foundation/sites/docs/panini.html">Panini</a> toolchain.</p>
